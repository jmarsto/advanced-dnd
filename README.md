I followed an Egghead tutorial from the author of react-beautiful-dnd, Alex Reardon.
https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd

and consulted the docs when things didn't work out.
https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/blob/master/README.md

I intend to use this library to allow for drag-and-drop editing on my train-smart project:
https://github.com/jmarsto/train-smart
goal: allow users to edit the calendar generated by the app with the simplicity of drag and drop

and to incoorporate similiar functionality in another side-project:
https://github.com/jmarsto/launch-pod-generator
goal: allow for easy manipulation of generated groups
